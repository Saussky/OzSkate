Any better name ideas? Check IG for availability?

found a list, probably not complete:
https://www.skateshopday.com/ (go to directory)

Use each website's url + 'products.json' (grab this from network request as 'node fetch') to get the shops data
Some of the URL's will need extra information ex. https://www.skateboard.com.au/collections/skateboard-decks-8-38/products.json
	- make a list for each website? make a crawler to find them all will probably take same amount of time but would learn more making one
	- can add parameters to product.json link. detailed [here](obsidian://open?vault=Name&file=Scraping%20Shopify%20Data)
Save it in a database
	- check data for each product type to make sure it all has same structure
	- have to automate the fetch process so it can update the site regularly
	- detailed [here](obsidian://open?vault=Name&file=Database%20%2B%20Hosting) (alongside hosting)
Also store each product, keep track of price history. Min max and median?
- challenge of stores labelling same products differently e.g. v1 and v2 new balances
Make a front-end that displays all of it with filter and sort options
	- redX for graphic design? use ui library?
Only Aus skate shops (no fast times (check ownership of each shop))
Have 'sale' section
Have 'Oz Brands' section
Filter by state, etc. only Adelaide shops
What about surf shops and snow shops that carry skateboards? Leaning towards no
Grow site using SLAP, Instagram ads, stickers (:)), skate shop gift card giveaway, reddit ads?
Talk to the stores?
Use website analytics to track customer behaviour
Once big enough, sell the data to the stores about where customers are going, trade for skate paraphenalia
	- use price history to measure elasticity of products and brands
		- sell information to people who think elasticity is a smart person word
When there's no need for more skate stuff, put ads on website
'Buy local', 'Support local', 'Rich people suck'
Sell a cheap board, with indigenous art on it?
Add streetwear? Ichpig, KlearCut. To find other states, find one small streetwear instagram and go through followers other follows
Get notified when a product reaches a certain price (sign up with email?)
Spotlight section with small brands
Second hand sales section? Take a cut :) - Call it classifieds ayy lmao

Offer to fix the skatebaord.com.au spots thing
Or offer to make an app
Earn points by posting spots
Or by posting clips at spots (bounties? (might be illegal))
Use the points for a discount at skateboard.com.au
There are other skate spot apps, check them out as research
Other idea - import all the skate spots to google maps as markers
might need a way to clear them too?
Both could work
Under 18 street montage competition - monthly, discount awards
Get other sponsors to offer things with points? Split profits with .au 50/50
Promise of always updating skate spots - syncs with maps?
